These are the first two generations of starter Pokemon. You may have heard of "Pokemon." They start in the incorrect numerical order, and you're supposed to hit the button to put them in order, but the button doesn't work and this is a brand new concept and we've worked on it for six hours, and it technically works correctly, so we're calling it a night (as of 6:02pm, August 20, 2014) without the button being entirely functional. The code does correctly sort the Pokemon.

This was made by Andrew and Craig. People who helped us include Dexter, Brook, Ryan, Lily, John, Jeff, Brian, and probably others.
